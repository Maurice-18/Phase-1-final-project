## Description

The **Fipe Vehicle Valuation App** allows users to check the current market value of a car, motorcycle, or truck in Brazil using the [FIPE Table API](https://parallelum.com.br/fipe/api/v1). The app features dynamic dropdowns for selecting vehicle type, brand, model, and year. Upon submission, the vehicle’s value and details are displayed — all without page reloads.

This project serves as a demonstration of:
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch API)
- DOM updates based on API data
- Event-driven programming
- Writing clean, DRY, and maintainable frontend code
